- Image to data:
	- Image validation (DONE)
	- Functionality for taking uploaded image file and converting to array representation
		- Need to be able to deal with colours other than black/white, as well as transition / colour gradients
		- Needs to be universal for all searching (or maze solving) algorithms
	- Array representation of maze to necessary data structure, if arrays do not work

- Maze array data
	- Need to get BFS, DFS, and any other algorithm for solving mazes from array representation
	- Need image library to draw solution path on image and show
		- Nice to have: steps the algorithm took in different colour, where the more recent steps are a darker colour
	- Need to show all maze solutions and data (time, iterations taken)
